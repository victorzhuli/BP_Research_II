Continuous wavelet transform module for Python. Includes a collection
of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via FFT
algorithm. This module references to the numpy, scipy and pylab Python
packages.

Now are inclued the Smooth operator, wavelet cross-spectrun and coherence
wavelet

The sample script (sample.py) illustrates the use of the wavelet and
inverse wavelet transforms and the results are plotted in a figure
similar to the sample_nino3.png image file.
